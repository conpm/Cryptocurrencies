# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to utilize unsupervised machine learning in order to categorize different cryptocurrencies to help better understand the cryptocurrency market, given there is such a large variety of cryptocurrencies.  In order to curate the results the data was filtered to only tradable cryptocurrencies which are being actively mined.  After cleaning the dataframe, the data was dimensionally reduced to three principal components, which were then used in order to cluster and classify the data.  Ultimately the clustered data was plotted onto two different scatter plots to help visualize the differences between the clusters.
